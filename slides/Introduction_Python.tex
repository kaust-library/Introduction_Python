Tanenbaum, who co-authored the book ``Operating systems: Design and Implementation,'' that would inspire Linus Torvalds to create the Linux kernel, as he wrote in his initial post ``Hello everybody out there using minix - I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones.''
    \end{itemize}
